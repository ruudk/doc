# Attestation and Metadata Statement

{% hint style="warning" %}
Disclaimer: you **should not** ask for the Attestation Statement unless you are working on an application that requires a high level of trust (e.g. Banking/Financial Company, Government Agency...).
{% endhint %}

With Symfony, you must enable this feature and define a Metadata Statement Repository in the configuration file.

{% code title="config/packages/webauthn.yaml" lineNumbers="true" %}
```yaml
webauthn:
    metadata_service:
        enabled: true
        repository: 'App\Repository\MyMetadataStatementRepository'
```
{% endcode %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
The modification of these parameters is not recommended. You should try to sync your server clock first.
{% endhint %}

### Credential Creation Options

By default, no Attestation Statement is asked to the Authenticators (type = `none`). To change this behavior, you just have to set the corresponding parameter in the `Webauthn\PublicKeyCredentialCreationOptions` object.

There are 3 conveyance modes available using PHP constants provided by the class `Webauthn\PublicKeyCredentialCreationOptions`:

* `ATTESTATION_CONVEYANCE_PREFERENCE_NONE`: the Relying Party is not interested in authenticator attestation (default)
* `ATTESTATION_CONVEYANCE_PREFERENCE_INDIRECT`: the Relying Party prefers an attestation conveyance yielding verifiable attestation statements, but allows the client to decide how to obtain such attestation statements.
* `ATTESTATION_CONVEYANCE_PREFERENCE_DIRECT`: the Relying Party wants to receive the attestation statement as generated by the authenticator.
* `ATTESTATION_CONVEYANCE_PREFERENCE_ENTERPRISE`: the Relying Party wants to receive uniquely identifying information from authenticators.



{% code title="config/packages/webauthn.yaml" %}

    user_repository: ...
    creation_profiles:

            attestation_conveyance: !php/const Webauthn\PublicKeyCredentialCreationOptions::ATTESTATION_CONVEYANCE_PREFERENCE_DIRECT
            rp:
                name: 'My application'
                id: 'example.com'
```
