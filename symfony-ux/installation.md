# Installation

The [Symfony UX Initiative](https://symfony.com/ux) allows adding high interaction application from Twig templates without a single line of JS.

With the version 4.1, a Stimulus Controller is provided. This component turns a basic login form into a Webauthn compatible one.

To use this nice feature, you first need to install and configure Symfony UX. Please refer to the [official documentation](https://symfony.com/doc/current/frontend/ux.html).

Then, install the package using composer:

```shell
composer require web-auth/webauthn-stimulus
```

It is now time to create your first form.
