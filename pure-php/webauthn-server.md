# Webauthn Server

To set up a Webauthn server, you'll require components from two main categories:

* [Input Loading](input-loading.md): serivces required to load the data and convert into DTO or other objects
* [Input Validation](input-validation.md): services required to verify the input data and return the result  of this validation

Upon completion, you'll have the capability to [register authenticators](authenticator-registration.md) and [verify the identity of your users](authenticate-your-users.md).
