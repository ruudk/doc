# What is Webauthn?

Webauthn defines an API enabling the creation and use of strong, attested, scoped, public key-based credentials by web applications, for the purpose of strongly authenticating users.

The complete specification can be found on [the W3C dedicated page](https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn-2/).

This framework contains PHP libraries and Symfony bundle to allow developers to integrate that authentication mechanism into their web applications.

## Class, Constant and Property Names

Naming things may be complicated. That‚Äôs why the following rule applies on the whole framework: the name of classes, constants and properties are identical to the ones you will find in the specification.

As an example, the [section 5.2.2 ‚ÄúWeb Authentication Assertion‚Äù](https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn-2/#iface-authenticatorassertionresponse) shows an object named `AuthenticatorAssertionResponse` that extends `AuthenticatorResponse` with the following properties:

* `authenticatorData`
* `signature`
*   `userHandle`

    You will find [EXACTLY the same structure](https://github.com/web-auth/webauthn-framework/blob/v3.0/src/webauthn/src/AuthenticatorAssertionResponse.php#L21) in the PHP class provided by the library.

## Compatible Authenticators

As of January 2023, our framework supports every authenticator with full feature and algorithm support, achieving a 100% success rate across all tests. Official FIDO Alliance testing tools have validated its compliance.

We ensure continuous conformity through rigorous unit and functional testing throughout the development process.
