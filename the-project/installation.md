description: How to install the library or the Symfony bundle?

# Installation

This framework contains several sub-packages that you donâ€™t necessarily need. It is highly recommended to install what you need and not the whole framework.

The preferred way to install the library you need is to use composer:

```bash
composer require web-auth/webauthn-lib
```

If you use Symfony Framework, you may be interested in the bundle and, optionally,  the Stimulus component.

```sh
composer require web-auth/webauthn-symfony-bundle web-auth/webauthn-stimulus
```
