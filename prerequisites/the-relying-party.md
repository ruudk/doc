# The Relying Party

The Relying Party (or `rp`) corresponds to the application that will ask for the user to interact with the authenticator.

The library provides a simple class to handle the rp information: `Webauthn\PublicKeyCredentialRpEntity`.

{% code lineNumbers="true" %}
```php
<?php

use Webauthn\PublicKeyCredentialRpEntity;

$rpEntity = PublicKeyCredentialRpEntity::create(
    'ACME Webauthn Server' // The application name
);
```
{% endcode %}

This `$rpEntity` object will be useful for the next steps.

## Relying Party ID

In the example above, we created a simple relying party object with it’s name. The relying party may also have an ID that corresponds to the domain applicable for that `rp`. By default, the relying party ID is `null` i.e. the current domain will be used.

It may be useful to specify the `rp` ID, especially if your application has several sub-domains. The rp ID can be set during the creation of the object as 2nd constructor parameter.

{% code lineNumbers="true" %}
```php
<?php

use Webauthn\PublicKeyCredentialRpEntity;

$rpEntity = PublicKeyCredentialRpEntity::create(
    'ACME Webauthn Server', // The application name
    'acme.com'              // The application ID = the domain
);
```
{% endcode %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Even if it is optional, we highly recommend setting the application ID
{% endhint %}

The `rp` ID shall be the domain of the application without the scheme, userinfo, port, path, user…. IP addresses are not allowed either.

{% hint style="success" %}
Allowed: `www.sub.domain.com`, `sub.domain.com`, `domain.com`
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
Not allowed:

* `www.sub.domain.com:1337`, `https://domain.com:443`, `sub.domain.com/index`, `https://user:password@www.domain.com`.
* `12.65.76.43` or `[2001:db8:85a3:8d3:1319:8a2e:370:7348]`
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
The domain `localhost` can be used if the browser considers the context is safe (especially the IP address corresponds to a local address)
{% endhint %}

### How to determine the Relying Party ID?

The Relying Party ID should be determined depending on the common URLs for your web application.

If you have a web application that can be reached at [https://m.my-app.com](https://m.my-app.com) (for mobiles) and [https://my-app.com](https://my-app.com) or [https://www.my-app.com](https://www.my-app.com) (for other devices), your Relying Party ID should be `my-app.com`.

If the domain is shared between sub-projects, the rp ID should be limited to that sub-projects.

For example, a web site is located at `https://(www.)site1.host.com` and another at `https://(www.)site2.host.com`, then the Relying Party IDs should be `site1.host.com` and `site2.host.com` respectively. If you set `host.com`, there is a risk that users from `site1.host.com` can log in at `site2.host.com`.

{% hint style="info" %}
Discussion is ongoing for associating authenticators to multiple RP IDs such as `my-company.com`, `meine-firma.de` et `ma-compagnie.fr`
{% endhint %}

## Relying Party Icon

Your application may also have a logo. You can indicate this logo as third argument. Please note that for safety reason this icon is a priori authenticated URL i.e. an image that uses the `data` scheme.

{% code lineNumbers="true" %}
```php
<?php

use Webauthn\PublicKeyCredentialRpEntity;

$rpEntity = PublicKeyCredentialRpEntity::create(
    'ACME Webauthn Server',
    'acme.com',
    'data:image/png;base64,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'
);
```
{% endcode %}

{% hint style="info" %}
The Webauthn specification does not set any limit for the length of the third argument.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
The icon may be ignored by browsers, especially if its length is greater than 128 bytes.
{% endhint %}
